# Check Deadlines

This project provides a simple command-line tool to check for deadlines in code files. It searches for a specific string format within your codebase, and if it finds any deadlines that have been exceeded, the tool will return a non-zero exit code. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect temporary workarounds that have reached their deadlines.

"Nothing is more permanent than a temporary workaround."
